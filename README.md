***This project is unfinished and not complete yet!***

Hydrazine is a command-line based, modular program that uses MCProtocolLib by Steveice10 ([link](https://github.com/Steveice10/MCProtocolLib)) to interact with a minecraft server. Its purpose is to check if the target is able to withstand a bot-based denial of service attack. Unfortunately, the program doesn't work with any other version except *Minecraft 1.8*.


## Features
* Cracked and Premium Server support
* Authentication proxy support
* Client proxy support (socks only)
* Ability to load cracked usernames and account credentials from file
* Delay between client connections (throttle delay)
* Module support
  * Default modules
