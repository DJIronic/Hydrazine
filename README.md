# Hydrazine

![MCVersion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Minecraft%20version-1.8-orange.svg)

***This project is unfinished and not complete yet!***

Hydrazine is a command-line based, modular program that uses MCProtocolLib by Steveice10 ([link](https://github.com/Steveice10/MCProtocolLib)) to interact with a minecraft server. Its purpose is to check if the target is able to withstand a bot-based denial of service attack. Unfortunately, the program doesn't work with any other version except *Minecraft 1.8*.
