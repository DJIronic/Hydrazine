# Hydrazine

***This project is unfinished and not complete yet!***

Hydrazine uses MCProtocolLib by Steveice10 ([link](https://github.com/Steveice10/MCProtocolLib)) to interact with a minecraft server. Its purpose is to check if a server is able to withstand a bot-based denial of service attack.

Hydrazine is currently only able to communicate with a minecraft 1.8 server. Any other version will not work.

* Authentication proxy support
* Client proxy support (socks only)
